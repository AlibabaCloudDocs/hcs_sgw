# Modify AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret

Cloud Storage Gateway V1.6.0 and later allows you to modify your AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret in the on-premises gateway console. This topic describes how to modify AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret in the on-premises gateway console.

1.  Open your browser. Enter `https://<IP address of the gateway>` in the address bar to connect to the on-premises gateway console.

2.  In the dialog box that appears, enter your username and password. Click **OK**.

3.  Click the profile picture in the upper-right corner of the page, and then click **Modify AK/SK**.

4.  In the **Modify AK/SK** dialog box, enter the AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret. Click **OK**.

5.  Restart the gateway.

    To restart the gateway, restart the virtual machine on which the gateway is deployed. The new AK and SK take effect after the gateway is restarted.
