# Deploy an on-premises console for a file gateway

This topic describes how to deploy an on-premises console for a file gateway by using an image. You must download and install the image. Then, you must configure network settings and activate the file gateway.

1.  You have registered an Alibaba Cloud account and passed real-name verification. For more information, see [Sign up with Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/50482.html).

    **Note:** We recommend that you log on to the CSG console as a RAM user. For more information, see [Use RAM to implement account-based access control](/intl.en-US/Best Practice/Use RAM to implement account-based access control.md).

2.  You have activated CSG.

    If this is your first time logging on to the , follow the instructions on the page to activate CSG.

3.  An Alibaba Cloud AccessKey pair is created. You can log on to the [User Management console](https://usercenter.console.aliyun.com/#/manage/ak) to obtain your AccessKey pair.

Cloud Storage Gateway \(CSG\) can be deployed in data centers. You can deploy an on-premises console for a file gateway on the following platforms: VMware vSphere, Hyper-V, and Kernel-based Virtual Machine \(KVM\). Before the deployment, you can download the corresponding gateway images in the CSG console to your computer.

**Note:**

-   OVA images V1.0.30 and later can be deployed only on web clients of vCenter V6.0 and later.
-   Images downloaded from the CSG console cannot be imported to ECS instances.

## Hardware requirements for virtual machines

The virtual machine where the on-premises file gateway is deployed must meet the following requirements:

-   The virtual machine has four vCPUs.
-   The virtual machine has at least 8 GB of memory resources.
-   The virtual machine has at least 100 GB of disk space. The disk space is used to install a CSG image and store system data.
-   We recommend that you use thick-provisioned cache disks on the virtual machine to optimize I/O performance. The size of each cache disk must be 40 GB or larger.

## Installation methods

Installation methods and installation files vary depending on the hypervisor. You can obtain an installation file when you create an on-premises file gateway.

|Hypervisor|Supported installation method|Installation file format|
|----------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
|VMware vSphere|Import an OVA image to VMware.|ova|
|KVM|Open the virt-manager and use the QCOW2 file.|qcow2|
|Hyper-V|Import a VHD file to Hyper-V.|vhd|

## Step 1: Download an image

1.  Log on to the [CSG console](https://sgwnew.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  Select the region where you want to create a file gateway.

3.  On the Gateway Clusters page, select the target gateway cluster, and then click **Create**.

    If you have not created a gateway cluster, click **Create Gateway Cluster** on the Overview page to create a gateway cluster.

4.  On the **Basic Information** page, set the following parameters and click **Next**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**Name**|Specify a name for the gateway. The name must be 1 to 60 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, periods \(.\), underscores \(\_\), and hyphens \(-\). It must start with a letter. |
    |**Location**|Select a place where you want to deploy the gateway. In this example, select **On-premises**.|
    |**Category**|Select the category of the gateway. In this example, select **Storage Gateway**.|
    |**Type**|Select the type of the gateway. In this example, select **File Gateway**.|

5.  Click Next to go to the **Paid Information** tab. Set the following parameters and click **Next**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**Billing Method**|Supported billing methods include **Pay-as-you-go** and **Subscription**. For more information, see [Pricing](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pricing.md). If you select **Subscription**, after you create the file gateway, you are redirected to the buy page of CSG to settle the payment. For more information, see [Purchase Cloud Storage Gateway](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription/Purchase a gateway.md). |
    |**After Expiration**|Specify how the the gateway is processed after it expires. You can select **Pay-as-you-go** or **Release After Expiration**.|

6.  On the Image Download tab, download the required image to your on-premises machine.


## Step 2: Install the image

After you download the image, you can use it to deploy an on-premises console for the file gateway. For more information, see [How do I deploy Cloud Storage Gateway instances in on-premises data centers?](https://help.aliyun.com/knowledge_detail/54123.html)

## Step 3: Configure network settings

After you install the gateway image, you can configure the gateway IP address in the command-line interface \(CLI\) of the gateway.

1.  Start the on-premises console of the file gateway, and open the Linux terminal of the virtual machine.

2.  Enter your username and password to log on to the gateway CLI.

    The default username is root and the default password is Alibaba\#sgw\#1030.

3.  Select a language.

    The virtual machine may not support Chinese characters. We recommend that you select English for further configurations.
