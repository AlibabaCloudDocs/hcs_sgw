|**v1.3.0**|March 6, 2020|New features: -   The transfer acceleration feature is supported by file gateways.
-   The duplicate mode of file gateways is enhanced to replicate data to local clients. This feature is available only to selected users.

|-   [Enable transfer acceleration](/intl.en-US/User Guide (Alibaba Cloud)/File Gateway/Enable transfer acceleration.md)
-   [Integration with CloudMonitor](/intl.en-US/Best Practice/Features/Integration with CloudMonitor.md) |
|Optimization of user experience: -   CSG supports API operations.
-   CSG can be integrated with Cloud Monitor.
-   The upload performance of big files in file gateways is improved.
-   CSG allows you to pay for network bandwidth upgrades. |
|Available in the following new regions: -   Malaysia \(Kuala Lumpur\)
-   US \(Silicon Valley\)
-   US \(Virginia\) |
|**v1.2.0**|January 8, 2020|New features: -   File gateways of the Enhanced and Advanced models support disk encryption by using a bring-your-own-key \(BYOK\) solution. This feature is available only to selected users.
-   File gateways allow you to associate multiple OSS buckets with the same share.

|[Associate a share with multiple OSS buckets](/intl.en-US/User Guide (Alibaba Cloud)/File Gateway/Associate a share with multiple OSS buckets.md)|
|Optimization of user experience: -   File gateways support fragment optimization by using the Network File System version 4 \(NFSv4\) protocol. If multiple requests for to upload a file to the OSS bucket are sent, the request is processed only once. File gateways cannot mount shares to local clients over NFSv3.
-   The express synchronization feature is optimized on the NFS client side. Metadata updates can be discovered by NFS clients in time. |
|**v1.1.0**|December 26, 2019|New features: -   File gateways support express synchronization. This feature detects data changes in OSS buckets without the need for a full scan. Express synchronization allows a single user to write data to and multiple users to read data from the same gateway at the same time.
-   File gateways support Windows access-based enumeration \(ABE\). Together with the Active Directory \(AD\) service, this feature can separate access requests from different accounts.

-   [Enable Windows access-based enumeration](/intl.en-US/User Guide (Alibaba Cloud)/File Gateway/Enable Windows access-based enumeration.md) |
|Optimization of user experience: -   The specification of CSG can be upgraded.
-   CSG supports automatic renewal of subscriptions. |
|Available in the following new regions: -   China \(Chengdu\)
-   Indonesia \(Jakarta\) |
